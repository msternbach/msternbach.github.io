									<h3 class="major">My Data Journey</h3>
									<p>I’m Michael, I’m currently an MBA student at Binghamton University and will be graduating in May 2024. I first
									became interested in data analytics/science last summer after taking a financial data analytics course. I didn’t
									know much about data analytics, but I enjoyed that class a lot so I decided to learn more about potential career
									paths. After reaching out to a few people and learning more about their careers I became set on getting a job in 
									data analytics. Ever since then that interest has blossomed into a passion. Over the past few months I’ve spent 
									countless hours learning new skills in python, SQL, and Tableau. Additionally, as someone who is very interested 
									in A.I., my goal of getting a data analytics job has started to shift to getting a data scientist job. I'm starting
									to look for jobs now, and I'm excited to find out where I end up. No matter where it is I plan on bringing my
									newfound skills to the table and continue onto the next phase of my data journey.</p>
									<p>This portfolio contains a collection of projects that I’ve worked on in the past year. I’m actively working on 
									new projects so there will be more added in the near future.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Python Job Board Web Scraping</h2>
										<p>In this project I used the Selenium package in Python to extract recent job data from various 
										online job boards. I’ve been using the data the scraper collected to help me in applying to jobs
									 	on those platforms. I provided the code and a few examples of datasets that the scraper extracted.

										<h2 class="major">SQL Data Analysis of NFL Qbs Effectiveness Against Different Defensive Schemes</h2>
										<p>In this project I analyzed how NFL quarterbacks have performed against different defensive coverages 
										over the past two years. My main findings were that certain coverages are run much more often than others, 
										and quarterbacks do perform differently based on different defensive schemes. I provided the code, results, 
										and analysis for each of the queries I ran. I encourage you to read the introduction as it provides 
										information on some of the intricacies of the project, and it also provides a little background on the 
										terminology for those that aren’t football fans.</p>

										<h2 class="major">TABLEAU VISUALIZATION OF NFL QBS EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE SCHEMES</h2>
										<p>I visualized the SQL project with a dashboard containing 3 charts. The chart on the top of the dashboard 
										compares the average stats of selected players accross different coverages. The one on the bottom left shows 
										how often each coverage was called on average against each quarterback. The one on the bottom right shows 
										individual player stats for every  game over the past two seasons, and the percentile the selected coverage 
										was run in those games. The dashboard is interactive. You can choose stat type, coverage type, and which players 
										you want to see on the visualization. I encourage you to play around with the dashboard and look at it in 
										fullscreen as it shows the best view.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Kaggle Home Price Prediction Using Python</h2>
										<p>This was a Kaggle competition where I had to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices. 
										It was the final project for my IT for Business Analytics class, and it was a competition amongst my 
										classmates with the person who built the best model getting the highest grade in the class. With a lot of 
										hard work I ended up outcompeting my peers and built the model with the lowest RMSE. You can look at my 
										Python notebook here:</p>
