									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<p>Hi, I’m Michael, a recent MBA graduate with a strong passion for data analytics. My interest in data began last summer after being exposed to it in one of my classes. Although I didn’t know much about analytics at the time, I reached out to professionals to learn more about their careers, and that exposure set me on the path to becoming a data analyst. Over the past year I’ve spent countless hours learning new skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau, and applying them to real-world challenges.</p>
									<p>This portfolio showcases the projects where I’ve turned data into actionable insights. From ranking top of my class in a Kaggle competition to building a comprehensive machine learning model to help me win my fantasy football league, each project helped me deepen my passion for analytics and helped me deliver data backed solutions to problems I’ve faced.</p>
									<p>When I’m not refining my analytics skills, I enjoy golfing, weightlifting, and running my personal eBay store.</p>

										<p>I've an oura ring for about a year, so I decided to do a data analysis project to what insights I could
										discover about my sleep over the past year. I was able to uncover some interesting patterns and some
										areas for improvement.

										<h2 class="major">Python Fantasy Football Project</h2>
										<p>This was a group project for my data science project class that I continued to work on after graduation. In 
										this project we predicted fantasy football scores of individual players for the 2024 NFL season.
										Our model results ended up being very intriguing, and I applied it to my own fantasy football draft.

										<h2 class="major">Python Job Board Web Scraping</h2>
										<p>In this project I used the Selenium package in Python to extract recent job data from various 
										online job boards. I’ve been using the collected data to help me in applying to jobs
									 	on these platforms. I provided the code and a few examples of datasets that the scraper extracted.

										<h2 class="major"> SQL and Tableau Data Analysis Project</h2>
										<p>In this project I analyzed how NFL quarterbacks have performed against different defensive coverages 
										over the past two years. My main findings were that certain coverages are run much more often than others, 
										and quarterbacks do perform differently based on different defensive schemes. I provided the code, results, 
										and analysis for each of the queries I ran, and also made a dashboard in Tableau containing 3 charts</p>

										<h2 class="major">Kaggle Home Price Prediction Using Python</h2>
										<p>This was a Kaggle competition where I had to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices. 
										It was the final project for my IT for Business Analytics class, and it was a competition amongst my 
										classmates with the person who built the best model getting the highest grade in the class. With a lot of 
										hard work I ended up outcompeting my peers and built the model with the lowest RMSE. You can look at my 
										Python notebook here:</p>
